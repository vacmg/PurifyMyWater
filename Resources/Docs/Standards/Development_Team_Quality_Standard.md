This standard was created to tell the code team how to work in different moments.

## Issues' creation and assigment
The diferent issues's are created. They need to have a reference to the technical design document from where they come from, and a reference to the module

## Create branch in dev / per technical designal
Create a branch in dev. That branch is associanted to a technical design document

## Create/Modify skeleton, commit and push 
Add the .h and the .cpp into the technical design branch

## Create Branch Issue -> Code Issue
