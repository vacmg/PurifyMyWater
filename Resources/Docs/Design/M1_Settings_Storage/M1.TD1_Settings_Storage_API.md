### Additional info:

This is the technical design of the unique class in the Settings module that is public. All the interactions from outside this module will be used from this class.

### API:

#### Macro CONFIG_SETTINGS_DISABLE_DELAYED_WRITE
- When this macro is true, it will disable the delayed write operations mechanism, by writing instantly to persistent storage after calling putSetting().
- When this macro is undefined or false, this behaviour will be disabled.
- Adding this item will allow to use "CONFIG_SETTINGS_DISABLE_DELAYED_WRITE" as a preprocessor macro to allow or exclude code from being compiled:

    ```
    #if defined(CONFIG_SETTINGS_DISABLE_DELAYED_WRITE)
    ...
    #endif
    ```

#### Macro CONFIG_SETTINGS_RETARDED_SAVE_TIME_MS
- Adding this macro will allow to use "CONFIG_SETTINGS_RETARDED_SAVE_TIME_MS" as a preprocessor macro to be used as symbol in the code with the value of the time to wait when using the delayed save mechanism:

    ```
    timer_set_counter_value(...,CONFIG_SETTINGS_RETARDED_SAVE_TIME_MS);
    ```

#### public Class Settings (static)

##### Class which handles all the interaction with Settings module

##### Structs:

- typedef enum  {NO_ERROR = 0, KEY_NOT_FOUND_ERROR, TYPE_MISMATCH_ERROR, KEY_EXISTS_ERROR, CORRUPTED_SETTINGS_FILE_ERROR} SettingError_t;
    // Enum that stores the possible errors returned by the API Settings

- typedef enum {VOID = 0, SETTING_LIST, FLOAT, INT, STRING} SettingValueType_t;
    // Enum with the types of data that can be saved

- typedef union {float FLOAT; int INT; std::string* STRING; std::unordered_map<std::string, struct SettingValue_t>* SETTING_MAP;} SettingValueData_t;
    // Union with the types of data that can be saved

- typedef struct SettingValue_t {
        SettingValueType_t settingValueType;
        SettingValueData_t settingValueData;
    } SettingValue_t;
    // The value of each map element SettingsMap_t

- typedef std::unordered_map<std::string, SettingValue_t> SettingsMap_t;
    // The data type that stores a map of key string and struct value with the settings

    - SettingValueType_t settingValueType (VOID/SETTINGS_MAP/FLOAT/INT/STRING)
        // A flag that tells what type of value it stores (in brackets are the possible values)

    - SettingValueData_t settingValueData
        // The value itself that is stored

##### Attributes:

- private SettingsMap_t* settingsMap
    // The pointer to the map that stores the settings
    Mutual exclusion must be guaranteed when accessing between reads and writes, and ensure that only one write can be made at a time.
    
- private bool initialized
    // Returns true if init has been called without irrecoverable errors, false otherwise

- public const SettingValue_t VOID_VALUE = {.settingValueType = VOID, .settingValueData = 0}
    // There is a special struct that has settingValueType = VOID and settingValueData indeterminate. It is used to indicate that this key is empty

##### Methods:

- public SettingError_t initialize()
    // Initialices settingsMap, gets & validate data from flash and store it in settingList using SettingsParser Class
    - Returns NO_ERROR if init process is ok, or CORRUPTED_SETTINGS_FILE_ERROR if the parser encounters an error
    - Even though the parser returns nullptr, Settings Storage must work, so depending on the error reported, the filesystem must be mounted, or a new empty map must be created, and is the responsability of the boot process to populate it with the factory default settings.
    - Initialized attribute value always change to true after calling this function.

- public void finalize()
    // This function saves the settingMap to persistent storage, deletes settingsMap object & set initialized to false. It is used in the shutdown process

- public SettingValue_t getSetting(const std::string& key)
    // Gets a settingsMap value (Object in RAM) given a path as key (if it is a submenu, it is separated by '/' character).
    Returns the SettingValue_t object associated with the key; or the special struct VOID_VALUE in case the key is not found.
    Several reads can be performed concurrently, but none during a write.

- public SettingError_t putSetting(...)
    - SettingError_t putSetting(const std::string& key, int value)
    - SettingError_t putSetting(const std::string& key, float value)
    - SettingError_t putSetting(const std::string& key, const char* value)
    // It updates the value associated to the key with the value in settingsMap and updates the copy in flash at the moment or in a delayed way (if it is a submenu, it is separated by the character '/').
    - Special care must be taken when working with pointers to objects, to avoid memory leaks, you must destroy the object to be replaced with delete, and create the substitute with new.
    - If the key is of a different type than the existing one, and is different from VOID, TYPE_MISMATCH is returned;
    - If the key doesn't exist in the store, it returns KEY_NOT_FOUND;
    - If it terminates correctly, NO_ERROR is returned.
    - It must be guaranteed that only one value can be written at a time, and cannot be written while reading.
    - The delayed write mechanism works as follows:
        1. When saving a setting with putSetting(), a timer is started with a time of CONFIG_SETTINGS_RETARDED_SAVE_TIME_MS milliseconds.
        2. When saving another setting with putSetting(), the timer is reset to the CONFIG_SETTINGS_RETARDED_SAVE_TIME_MS milliseconds value.
        3. When the timer reaches its end, SettingsParser::writeToFile() is called to save the settings.

- public SettingError_t addSetting(const std::string& key)
    // Creates a new setting with the key key, and the special struct VOID_VALUE
    (if it is a submenu, it is separated by the '/' character and creates all the necessary submenus if they do not already exist).
    If the key already exists, returns KEY_EXISTS;
    If successful, NO_ERROR is returned.
    It must be guaranteed that only one value can be written at a time, and cannot be written while reading.
    
- public const char* getSettingsTree(const std::string& key)
    // This function returns a formatted string (allocated in heap) using fmt library with the subtree that hangs from key (in a recursive way):
    KEY_STR
    |-SUBKEY1_STR --- VALUE1
    |-SUBKEY2_STR --- VALUE2
    |-SUBMAP_STR
    | |-SUBKEY3_STR --- VALUE3
    |-SUBKEY4_STR --- VALUE4
    - If key is not a SETTINGS_MAP entry, it returns only the entry pointed by key (KEY_STR --- VALUE). 
    - If the key points to a SETTINGS_MAP entry, it returns the whole subtree:
    - If the key is '/', nullptr or '': it will return the complete settings tree.
    - If the key does not exist: it will return nullptr

- public const bool writeSettingsToPersistentStorage()
    // This function writes the current settingsMap to flash using the SettingsParser_t class
    - If delayed write is enabled, it will also cancel the timer if it is active

##### Example:

    - Example data:
	    Settings are stored in SettingsMap_t as follows:
        - [...] indicate a map.
        - (...) indicates the spacing between each SettingValue_t.
        - (...) indicates a SettingValue_t

        SettingMap_t: [ ('Setting1', 23.56), ('Energy', [ ('MaxVoltage',12), ('SensorName', 'MySensorName') ]) ]

    - Example of API usage:

        int main()
        {
            if(Settings::init() == Settings::NO_ERROR)
            {
                Settings::addSetting("setting1");
                Settings::putSetting("setting1", "value1");
                
                const char* buff = Settings::getSettingsTree("/");
                fmt::print("{}",buff);
                free(buff);

                Settings::SettingValue_t res = Settings::getSetting("setting1");
                if(res.settingValueType!=Settings::STRING)
                    return -1;
                const char* string = res.settingValueData.STRING->c_str();
                
                Settings::writeSettingsToPersistentStorage();
            }
            return 0;
        }
