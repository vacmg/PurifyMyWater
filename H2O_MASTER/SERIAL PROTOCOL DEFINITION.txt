Message must not exceed 32 bytes and message with Header and CRC must not exceed 38 + 1 (NULL) bytes
Each message finish with a \n (it is sended with Serial.println(msg))

package begin 'A' --> ping command (followed by crc)
package begin 'Z' --> pong command (followed by crc)
package begin 'D' --> begin of a message (which may include or not some data)
package begin '_' --> begin of a debug message. if debug == 1, mirror the message up to the first '\n' to Serial0 (aka USB Serial port). Else clean the serial buffer up to the first '\n'
package begin '-' --> processing the message (communication internal message) (followed by command OK , R (resend) , C (Corrupted) or F (failure)) (followed by crc)

followed by: X,Y* where X is a command, and Y* is some data
Y* data may follow this scheme: Y','Y2','... i.e: h,67,2045

followed by ',C' and the CRC8 of the begin and body of the message

Full example: "Df,45039,hello,2,C27"
That message sends the command 'f' with the data "45039", "hello", "2" and its CRC8 is 27
The crc8 code was calculated using "Df,45,hello,2" as input
