After using installToolchain.sh, you must configure clion to build the project. If you want to use idf.py as your build tool, run this line everytime you open a new termianl to use idf.py: . ./esp-idf/export.sh

To configure clion, follow this steps:

1: Go to Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | CMake and use the Environment field to add a new variable called IDF_PATH.
Set the value to the esp-idf folder path

2: run this line: . ./esp-idf/export.sh
run echo %PATH%.
Copy everything that contains the .espressif folder.
Navigate to CMake settings again, open the Environment field, and find PATH in the list of system variables.
Prepend the value with what you have just copied. Make sure there is a semicolon at the end of the paste.

3: Go to Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | CMake and change the build directory to build & generator to ninja

4: Reload cmake

5: To build the app: select the app configuration on the build profile & click on the build icon (hammer)

6: To flash the mcu: select the flash configuration on the build profile & click on the build icon (hammer)

7: To open the monitor on the mcu: select the monitor configuration on the build profile & click on the build icon (hammer)
If build fails, Go to Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | CMake and use the Environment field to add a new variable called ESPPORT with the ESP detected port as value
